# RealTextView

A new TextView for Android that includes a compilation of libraries to make a real TextView.
A lot of good libraries out there, but always I had to import each one, why not to merge and improve
them in a unique library.

This is what RealTextView does. As well for Button, CheckBox and EditText.

## Features:

* Autofit TextView, set a desired size and a minimun size, and never worry about if a text fits</li>
* Set any kind of font, only to a textview or set it as a theme for all the TextViews</li>
* RealTextView and RealButton with indeterminate progress loading</li>
* HTML text view extension, use RealTextView with html String.</li>

## Sample

## Usage

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.hardsoftstudio.real.textview:library:0.9.0'
}
```

SDK version >= 14

### AutoFit:

The Autofit function is enabled by default with a minimum size of 12dip. If you want to disabled use
the real:autoEnabled="false" tag in the XML or by code with the setAutoFit(false).

XML usage:

```
<com.hardsoftstudio.real.textview.views.RealTextView
            //the normal xml tags
            android:singleLine="true" // or android:maxLines="n" must set a limit in order to compute the autofit
            android:textSize="30sp"
            real:minTextSize="5sp" />
```

### Font:

The RealTextView allows to set custom fonts using assets resources, you can set up just for a TextView
or you can set it up as style and theme.

As a theme

```
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="android:Theme.Holo.Light.DarkActionBar">
        <item name="fontifyStyle">@style/CustomTextViewStyle</item>
    </style>

    <style name="CustomTextViewStyle">
        <item name="font">@string/app_default_font</item>
    </style>

    <!-- in strings.xml -->
    <string name="app_default_font">fonts/RobotoCondensed-Light.ttf</string>
```

Just for a textview

```
<com.hardsoftstudio.real.textview.views.RealTextView
            android:maxLines="2"
            real:font="fonts/Roboto-Black.ttf"
            real:minTextSize="8sp" />
```

The font can be set from Java code but the good thing of this lib is to avoid setting up the font in
java code everytime.

### Extended TextView HTML tags

* ``<ul>``
* ``<ol>``
* ``<dd>``
* ``<li>``
* ``<code>``
* ``<center>``

### Set HTML

```
text.setHtmlFromString(
                "<center><h2>You can load images and use center tag</h2>" +
                "<img src=\""+imgUrl+"\"></center>" +
                "<h3>You can list as well</h3>"+
                "<ul>\n" +
                "  <li>Coffee</li>\n" +
                "  <li>Tea</li>\n" +
                "  <li>Milk</li>\n" +
                "</ul>" +
                "<h3>You can use cites and a lot of more tags</h3>" +
                "<p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edward Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>",false);
```

In order to correctly display the image, the size must be set. This is an problem of using html in the textview
To fix this the best solution approached is this:
```
String imgUrl = RealUrl.makeImageUrl("Url to any image", 512, 512, Gravity.START);
```

Must remark that it's not a WebView it's a TextView! So it has it's pros and contras.

### Indeterminate progress Text

You can use RealTextView or RealButton to set a Indeterminate text to show a loading efect.
```
    mRealButton.setIndeterminateLoadingButton(isAnimated,isReverseMode,"Loading...");
```
The code above will change the text of the Button and make a writing animation forward and backwards if
isReverseMode=true
